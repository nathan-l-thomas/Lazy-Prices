DocumentExhibit 4.29DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT&#8217;S SECURITIESREGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIESEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934United Airlines Holdings, Inc., (&#8220;UAL,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) has two classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;)&#58; our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), and the rights (each, a &#8220;Right&#8221; and, collectively, the &#8220;Rights&#8221;) to purchase from UAL one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Serial Preferred Stock, without par value (&#8220;Series A Preferred Stock&#8221;).UAL is authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value (&#8220;Serial Preferred Stock&#8221;). UAL is also authorized to issue and has issued one share of Class Pilot MEC Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and one share of Class IAM Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. The general terms and provisions of our Common Stock and Rights are summarized below. It may not contain all the information that is important to you. For additional information, you should refer to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the &#8220;Certificate of Incorporation&#8221;), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &#8220;Bylaws&#8221;) and the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, dated as of December 4, 2020 and as amended on January 21, 2021 (the &#8220;Tax Benefits Preservation Plan&#8221;), by and between UAL and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (and any successor agent, the &#8220;Rights Agent&#8221;), each of which is an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this description is an exhibit and is incorporated herein by reference. Please also refer to the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (&#8220;DGCL&#8221;) for additional information.DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCKListingOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol &#8220;UAL.&#8221;DividendsThe holders of shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared payable, from time to time by the UAL board of directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;).LiquidationUpon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of UAL, after all securities ranking prior to the Common Stock, including any shares of UAL&#8217;s Serial Preferred Stock, Class Pilot MEC Junior Preferred Stock and Class IAM Junior Preferred Stock, have been paid in full that to which they are entitled, the holders of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock will be entitled to receive, pro rata, the remaining assets of UAL available for distribution to its stockholders.Voting Rights ;;;;Each outstanding share of Common Stock will entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders. At meetings of stockholders, holders of Common Stock vote together as a single class with holders of UAL&#8217;s Class Pilot MEC Junior Preferred Stock and Class IAM Junior Preferred Stock on all matters except the election of directors to the Board. Except as otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation, each director shall be elected by vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director&#8217;s election. However, if the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at any meeting of stockholders as of the date that is 10 days prior to the date UAL files its definitive proxy statement with the SEC, then each director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast and entitled to vote on the election of directors. The affirmative vote of holders of shares of UAL&#8217;s capital stock representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to be cast on the matter will be required to approve any other matters.Absence of Other Rights4891-2031-3936v.1         Shares of Common Stock are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any other class or series of capital stock. Holders of Common Stock have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or purchase additional securities of UAL. The Certificate of Incorporation contains no sinking fund provisions or redemption provisions with respect to the Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock are not subject to calls or assessments. No personal liability will attach to holders under the laws of the State of Delaware (UAL&#8217;s state of incorporation) or of the State of Illinois (the state in which UAL&#8217;s principal place of business is located). There is no classification of the Board.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTSRights to Purchase Preferred StockIn connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one Right to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2020 (the &#8220;Record Date&#8221;). Each Right entitles its holder, under the circumstances described below, to purchase from UAL one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, at an exercise price of $250.00 per Right, subject to adjustment.The Rights attach to any shares of Common Stock that were outstanding as of the Record Date or becomes outstanding after the Record Date and prior to the earlier of the Distribution Time (as defined below) and the Expiration Time (as defined below), and in certain other circumstances described in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.Until the Distribution Time, the Rights are associated with Common Stock and evidenced by Common Stock certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares of Common Stock, the book-entry account that evidences record ownership of such shares, which contains a notation incorporating the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan by reference, and the Rights are transferable with and only with the underlying shares of Common Stock. Separation and Distribution of Rights&#59; Exercisability Subject to certain exceptions, the Rights become exercisable and trade separately from Common Stock only upon the &#8220;Distribution Time,&#8221; which occurs upon the earlier of&#58;&#8226;  the close of business on the tenth (10th) day after the &#8220;Stock Acquisition Date&#8221; (which is defined as (a) the first date of public announcement that any person or group has become an &#8220;Acquiring Person,&#8221; which is defined as a person or group that, together with its affiliates and associates, beneficially owns 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (with certain exceptions, including those described below) or (b) such other date, as determined by the Board, on which a person or group has become an Acquiring Person) or&#8226;  the close of business on the tenth (10th) business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Board prior to such time as any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person) after the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.The Board may determine that any person is an Acquiring Person if such person becomes the beneficial owner of 4.9% of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock under the regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). An Acquiring Person does not include&#58;&#8226;  UAL or any subsidiary of UAL&#59; &#8226;  any officer, director or employee of UAL or any subsidiary of UAL in his or her capacity as such&#59; &#8226;  any employee benefit plan of UAL or of any subsidiary of UAL or any entity or trustee holding (or acting in a fiduciary capacity in respect of) shares of capital stock of UAL for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or for the purpose of funding other employee benefits for employees of UAL or any subsidiary of UAL&#59; &#8226;  any person or group, together with its affiliates and associates, whose beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock will not jeopardize or endanger the availability to 2UAL of any net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) or other tax attribute, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion prior to the time any person becomes an Acquiring Person (provided that such person will be an Acquiring Person if the Board subsequently makes a contrary determination in its sole discretion, regardless of the reason for such contrary determination)&#59; or &#8226;  any person or group that, together with its affiliates and associates, as of immediately prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, beneficially owns 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock so long as such person or group continues to beneficially own at least 4.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and does not acquire shares of Common Stock to beneficially own an amount equal to or greater than the greater of 4.9% and the sum of the lowest beneficial ownership of such person or group since the public announcement of the adoption of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan plus one share of Common Stock. In addition, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan provides that no person or group will become an Acquiring Person as a result of share purchases or issuances directly from UAL or through an underwritten offering approved by the Board. Also, a person or group will not be an Acquiring Person if the Board determines that such person or group has become an Acquiring Person inadvertently and such person or group as promptly as practicable divests a sufficient number of shares so that such person or group would no longer be an Acquiring Person. There are also certain exceptions for an &#8220;investment advisor&#8221; to mutual funds or a trustee of trusts qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code sponsored by unrelated corporations, unless the Board determines, in its reasonable discretion, that such investment advisor or trustee is deemed to beneficially own 4.9% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding under specified regulations promulgated under the Code.Certain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions, whether or not such interests are considered to be ownership of the underlying Common Stock or are reportable for purposes of Regulation 13D of the Exchange Act are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of shares of Common Stock equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative position, to the extent actual shares of Common Stock are directly or indirectly held by counterparties to the derivatives contracts. In addition, for purposes of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, a person or group is deemed to beneficially own shares that such person is deemed to directly, indirectly or constructively own (as determined for purposes of Section 382 of the Code or the regulations promulgated under the Code), and Warrants and Warrant Shares (as each is defined in the Warrant Agreement, dated as of April 20, 2020, between UAL and the United States Department of the Treasury, the Warrant Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2020, between UAL and the United States Department of the Treasury, and the Warrant Agreement, dated as of January 15, 2021, between UAL and the United states Department of the Treasury) are disregarded for purposes of determining beneficial ownership.Expiration TimeThe Rights will expire on the earliest to occur of (a) the close of business on December 4, 2023 (the &#8220;Final Expiration Time&#8221;), (b) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged by UAL (as described below), (c) the close of business on the first business day following the certification of the voting results of UAL&#8217;s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, if stockholder approval of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan has not been obtained at such meeting, (d) upon the closing of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving UAL pursuant to a merger or other acquisition agreement that has been approved by the Board before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person or (e) the time at which the Board determines that the NOLs and certain other tax attributes are utilized in all material respects or that an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code would not adversely impact in any material respect the time period in which UAL could use the NOLs and other tax attributes or materially impair the amount of NOLs and other tax attributes that could be used by UAL in any particular time period, for applicable tax purposes (the earliest of (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) being herein referred to as the &#8220;Expiration Time&#8221;). Flip-in EventIn the event that any person or group (other than certain exempt persons) becomes an Acquiring Person (a &#8220;Flip-in Event&#8221;), each holder of a Right (other than such Acquiring Person, any of its affiliates or associates or certain transferees of such Acquiring Person or of any such affiliate or associate, whose Rights automatically become null and void) will have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. For example, at an exercise price of $250.00 per Right, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person (or by certain related parties) following a Flip-in Event would entitle its holder to purchase $500.00 worth of Common Stock for $250.00. Assuming that Common Stock had a per share value of $50.00 at that time, the holder of each valid Right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of Common Stock for $250.00.3Flip-over EventIn the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, any of the following occurs (each, a &#8220;Flip-over Event&#8221;)&#58;&#8226;  UAL consolidates with, or merges with and into, any other entity, and UAL is not the continuing or surviving entity&#59;&#8226;  any entity engages in a share exchange with or consolidates with, or merges with or into, UAL, and UAL is the continuing or surviving entity and, in connection with such share exchange, consolidation or merger, all or part of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other entity or cash or any other property&#59; or&#8226;  UAL sells or otherwise transfers, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, 50% or more of UAL&#8217;s assets, cash flow or earning power, each holder of a Right (except Rights which previously have been voided as described above) will have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.Preferred Stock ProvisionsEach share of Series A Preferred Stock, if issued&#58; will not be redeemable, will entitle the holder thereof, when, as and if declared, to quarterly dividend payments equal to the greater of $1,000 per share and 1,000 times the amount of all cash dividends plus 1,000 times the amount of non-cash dividends or other distributions paid on one share of Common Stock, will entitle the holder thereof to receive $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends per share upon liquidation and, if shares of Common Stock are exchanged via merger, consolidation or a similar transaction, will entitle the holder thereof to a per share payment equal to the payment made on 1,000 shares of Common Stock.Anti-Dilution AdjustmentsThe exercise price payable, and the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution&#58;&#8226;  in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Series A Preferred Stock, &#8226;  if holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are granted certain rights, options or warrants to subscribe for Series A Preferred Stock or convertible securities at less than the current market price of the Series A Preferred Stock or&#8226;  upon the distribution to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the exercise price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to at least 1% of the exercise price. No fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be issued and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.Redemption&#59; ExchangeAt any time prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the Stock Acquisition Date or (ii) the Final Expiration Time, UAL may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right (subject to adjustment and payable in cash, Common Stock or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Board). Immediately upon the action of the Board authorizing any redemption or at such later time as the Board may establish for the effectiveness of the redemption, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price.At any time after any Acquiring Person, together with all of its affiliates and associates, becomes the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, UAL may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by the Acquiring Person, any of its affiliates or associates or certain transferees 4of Acquiring Person or of any such affiliate or associate, whose Rights will have become null and void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (or of a share of a class or series of Serial Preferred Stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), per Right (subject to adjustment).Exemption RequestsA person desiring to effect a transaction that might result in such person becoming a beneficial owner of 4.9% or more of the then-outstanding shares of Common Stock may, by following the procedures outlined in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, request that the Board determine that such person would not be an Acquiring Person. In such case, the Board may grant the exemption notwithstanding the effect on UAL&#8217;s NOLs and other tax attributes, if the Board determines that such approval is in the best interests of UAL. The Board may impose any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection with any such determination, including restrictions on the ability of the requesting person to transfer shares acquired by it in the transaction requiring approval. Amendment of the Tax Benefits Preservation PlanUAL and the Rights Agent may from time to time amend or supplement the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan without the consent of the holders of the Rights. However, on or after the Stock Acquisition Date, no amendment can materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights (other than the Acquiring Person, any of its affiliates or associates or certain transferees of Acquiring Person or of any such affiliate or associate).MiscellaneousWhile the distribution of the Rights is not taxable to stockholders or to UAL, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for Common Stock (or other consideration) or for common stock of the acquiring company or in the event of the redemption of the Rights as described above.FOREIGN OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONThe Certificate of Incorporation limits the total number of shares of equity securities held by all persons who fail to qualify as citizens of the United States to having no more than 24.9% of the voting power of all outstanding equity securities of UAL.CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER EFFECTSGeneral. Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and the DGCL could make it more difficult to consummate an acquisition of control of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy fight, open market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our Board. The summary of the provisions set forth below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and the DGCL.Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our ability to issue undesignated Serial Preferred Stock makes it possible for the Board to issue Serial Preferred Stock with super voting, dividend or other special rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire UAL. This may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of UAL.No Stockholder Action by Written Consent. The Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by UAL stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by consent in writing by such stockholders.Limitations on Stockholder Rights to Call Special Meetings. The Bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only (i) by both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson of the Board, (ii) by the Board or (iii) subject to certain requirements set forth in the Bylaws, by the Secretary, upon the written request of one or more stockholders of record of UAL that together have continuously held, for their own account or on behalf of others, beneficial ownership of at least a 25% aggregate &#8220;net long position&#8221; (as defined in the Bylaws) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock for at least one year prior to the date such request is delivered to UAL.Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Meetings, Nominations and Proposals&#59; Meeting Procedures. The Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as directors to the Board (other than nominations pursuant to 5the terms of the Class Pilot MEC Junior Preferred Stock, the Class IAM Junior Preferred Stock or nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee of the Board). In order for any matter to be &#8220;properly brought&#8221; before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide UAL with certain information. Under the Bylaws, the Board may also adopt rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of stockholder meetings as the Board deems appropriate, and except to the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures adopted by the Board, the person presiding at any meeting of stockholders has the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such person, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct of the meeting, which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These procedures and provisions may deter, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror&#8217;s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of UAL.No Stockholder Filling of Vacancies. Board vacancies and newly created directorships may only be filled by a vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Thus, even if stockholders remove a director from office, the vacancy created by such removal may only be filled by the Board.Business Combinations. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. Section 203 prevents certain Delaware corporations from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a &#8220;business combination&#8221; (as defined therein), which includes, among other things, a merger or sale of more than 10% of the corporation&#8217;s assets, with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a stockholder who acquired 15% or more of the corporation&#8217;s outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of such person.Tax Benefits Preservation Plan. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could have certain anti-takeover effects because the Rights provided to holders of our Common Stock under the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan will cause substantial dilution to an Acquiring Person. While the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to preserve our current ability to utilize NOLs and certain other tax attributes, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from accumulating more than 4.9% of UAL&#8217;s securities, which could delay or discourage attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board.CHOICE OF FORUM;;;;The Bylaws provide that, unless a majority of the Board, acting on behalf of UAL, consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for&#58; (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of UAL, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of UAL to UAL or UAL&#8217;s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against UAL or any of its directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Bylaws or the Certificate of Incorporation (in each case, as may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action asserting a claim against UAL or any of its directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware or (v) any other action asserting an &#8220;internal corporate claim,&#8221; as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL, in all cases subject to the court&#8217;s having personal jurisdiction over all indispensable parties named as defendants, and (b) the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, it is possible that a court could find UAL&#8217;s forum selection provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable. Furthermore, because the applicability of the exclusive forum provision is limited to the extent permitted by law, UAL does not intend that the exclusive forum provision described in clause (a) above would apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.6

The Company charges fees, separately from ticket sales, for certain ancillary services that are directly related to passengers' travel, such as baggage fees, premium seat fees, inflight amenities fees, and other ticket-related fees. These ancillary fees are part of the travel performance obligation and, as such, are recognized as passenger revenue when the travel occurs. The Company recorded $3.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion of ancillary fees within passenger revenue in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(c)Ticket Taxes&#8212;Certain governmental taxes are imposed on the Company's ticket sales through a fee included in ticket prices. The Company collects these fees and remits them to the appropriate government agency. These fees are recorded on a net basis and, as a result, are excluded from revenue.(d)Frequent Flyer Accounting&#8212;United's MileagePlus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for travel on United, United Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of;non-airline;partners. We have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from one to seven years. These partners include domestic and international credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government-imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and;non-travel;awards.Miles Earned in Conjunction with Travel. When frequent flyers earn miles for flights, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the travel occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a separate performance obligation. The Company determines the estimated selling price of travel and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements, individually, on a pro-rata basis. At the time of travel, the Company records the portion allocated to the miles to Frequent flyer deferred revenue on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and subsequently recognizes it into revenue when miles are redeemed for air travel and non-air travel awards.Estimated Selling Price of Miles. The Company's estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. The equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months' weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by breakage that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.Estimate of Miles Not Expected to be Redeemed ("Breakage"). The Company's breakage model is based on the assumption that the likelihood that an account will redeem its miles can be estimated based on a consideration of the account's historical behavior. The Company uses a logit regression model to estimate the probability that an account will redeem its current miles balance. The Company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information. The Company's estimate of the expected breakage of miles requires management judgment and current and future changes to breakage assumptions, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program. For the portion of the outstanding miles that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining miles are redeemed.Co-Brand Agreement. United has a contract (the "Co-Brand Agreement") to sell MileagePlus miles to its co-branded credit card partner JPMorgan Chase Bank USA, N.A. ("Chase"). Chase awards miles to MileagePlus members based on their credit card activity. United identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the Co-Brand Agreement:&#8226;MileagePlus miles awarded &#8211; United has a performance obligation to provide MileagePlus cardholders with miles to be used for air travel and non-travel award redemptions. The Company records Passenger revenue related to the travel awards when the transportation is provided and records Other revenue related to the non-travel awards when the goods or services are delivered. The Company records the cost associated with non-travel awards in Other operating revenue, as an agent.&#8226;Marketing &#8211; United has a performance obligation to provide Chase access to United's customer list and the use of United's brand. Marketing revenue is recorded to Other operating revenue as miles are delivered to Chase.&#8226;Advertising &#8211; United has a performance obligation to provide advertising in support of the MileagePlus card in various customer contact points such as United's website, email promotions, direct mail campaigns, airport advertising and in-flight advertising. Advertising revenue is recorded to Other operating revenue as miles are delivered to Chase.&#8226;Other travel-related benefits &#8211; United's performance obligations are comprised of various items such as waived bag fees, seat upgrades and lounge passes. Lounge passes are recorded to Other operating revenue as customers use the lounge passes. Bag fees and seat upgrades are recorded to Passenger revenue at the time of the associated travel.We account for all the payments received under the Co-Brand Agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations. The fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using management's estimated selling price of each component. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the Co-Brand Agreement, at the inception of the contract, in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered. We also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of the estimated consideration from the Co-Brand Agreement on a prospective basis.Frequent Flyer Deferred Revenue. Miles in MileagePlus members' accounts are combined into one homogeneous pool and are thus not separately identifiable, for award redemption purposes, between miles earned in the current period and those in their beginning balance. Of the miles expected to be redeemed, the Company expects the majority of these miles to be redeemed within two years. The table below presents a roll forward of Frequent flyer deferred revenue (in millions):In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized, in Other operating revenue, $2.4 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, related to the marketing, advertising, non-travel miles redeemed (net of related costs) and other travel-related benefits of the mileage revenue associated with our various partner agreements including, but not limited to, our Co-Brand Agreement. The portion related to the MileagePlus miles awarded of the total amounts received is deferred and presented in the table above as an increase to the frequent flyer liability. We determine the current portion of our frequent flyer liability based on expected redemptions in the next 12 months.(e)Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash&#8212;Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less on their acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash is classified as short-term or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of return of the assets to the Company or payment to an outside party.Restricted cash-current&#8212;The December 31, 2022 balance includes amounts to be used for the payment of fees, principal and interest on the $6.1 billion of senior secured notes and a secured term loan facility (the "MileagePlus Financing") secured by substantially all of the assets of Mileage Plus Holdings, LLC ("MPH"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of United.Restricted cash-non-current&#8212;The December 31, 2022 balance primarily includes collateral associated with the MileagePlus Financing, collateral for letters of credit and collateral associated with facility leases and other insurance-related obligations.The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of consolidated cash flows (in millions):(f)Investments&#8212;Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses on sales of these investments are reflected in Miscellaneous, net in the consolidated statements of operations.;Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence over an investee. Equity investments for which we do not have significant influence are recorded at fair value or at cost, if fair value is not readily determinable, with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). Changes in fair value are recorded in Unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 8 of this report for additional information related to investments.(g)Securities received in connection with purchase agreements&#8212;The Company accounts for the value of securities received from vendors as deferred credits that will generally be recognized as a reduction to the cost of the asset received in future periods.(h)Accounts Receivable&#8212;Accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies, non-airline partners, and cargo customers. We provide an allowance for credit losses expected to be incurred. We base our allowance on various factors including, but not limited to, aging, payment history, write-offs, macro-economic indicators and other credit monitoring indicators. Credit loss expense and write-offs related to trade receivables were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.(i)Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies&#8212;The Company accounts for aircraft fuel, spare parts and supplies at average cost and provides an obsolescence allowance for aircraft spare parts with an assumed residual value of 10% of original cost.(j)Property and Equipment&#8212;The Company records additions to owned operating property and equipment at cost when acquired. Property under finance leases and the related obligation for future lease payments are recorded at an amount equal to the initial present value of those lease payments. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of airframes or engines are capitalized as property and equipment. We periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines including those related to contractual damages related to delays in delivery. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are delivered and then applied as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment.Depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease, including estimated facility renewal options when renewal is reasonably certain at key airports, or the estimated useful life of the related asset, whichever is less. Properties under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the lease or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Amortization of finance lease assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:As of December;31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a carrying value of computer software of $471 million and $499 million, respectively. For the years ended December;31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company's amortization expense related to computer software was $166 million, $182 million and $172 million, respectively. Aircraft, spare engines and related rotable parts were assumed to have residual values of approximately 10% of original cost, and other categories of property and equipment were assumed to have no residual value.(k)Long-Lived Asset Impairments&#8212;The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. For purposes of this testing, the Company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for its mainline fleet and the contract level for its regional fleet under capacity purchase agreements ("CPAs"). An impairment charge is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows. The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair market value.The Company recorded impairment charges related to certain of its aircraft, related engines and spare parts of $97;million and $94;million for the years ended December;31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 13 of this report for additional information related to impairments.(l)Intangibles&#8212;The Company has finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of October;1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.We value goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily using market and income approach valuation techniques. These measurements include the following key assumptions: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) terminal period revenue growth and cash flows, (3) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (4) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (5) a tax rate. These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use. Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates.In 2022, the Company evaluated its intangible assets for possible impairments. For the Company's China route authority, the Company performed a quantitative assessment which involved determining the fair value of the asset and comparing that amount to the asset's carrying value. For all other intangible assets, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more likely than not that an impairment had occurred. To determine fair value, the Company used discounted cash flow methods appropriate for each asset. Key inputs into the models included forecasted capacity, revenues, fuel costs, other operating costs and an overall discount rate. The assumptions used for future projections include that demand will continue to recover. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events and circumstances. See Note 13 of this report for additional information related to impairments.;;;;The following table presents information about the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets at December;31 (in millions):Amortization expense in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $41 million, $49 million and $55 million, respectively. Projected amortization expense in 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 is $37 million, $32 million, $28 million, $18 million and $11 million, respectively.(m)Labor Costs&#8212;The Company records expenses associated with new or amendable labor agreements when the amounts are probable and estimable. These could include costs associated with retro-active lump sum cash payments made in conjunction with the ratification of labor agreements. To the extent these upfront costs are in lieu of future pay increases, they would be capitalized and amortized over the term of the labor agreements. If not, these amounts would be expensed.(n)Share-Based Compensation&#8212;The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Obligations for cash-settled restricted stock units ("RSUs") are remeasured at fair value throughout the requisite service period at the close of the reporting period based upon UAL's stock price. In addition to the service requirement, certain RSUs have performance metrics that must be achieved prior to vesting. These awards are accrued based on the expected level of achievement at each reporting period. An adjustment is recorded each reporting period to adjust compensation expense based on the then current level of expected performance achievement for the performance-based awards. See Note 4 of this report for additional information on UAL's share-based compensation plans.(o)Maintenance and Repairs&#8212;The cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of minor replacements, is charged to expense as incurred, except for costs incurred under our power-by-the-hour ("PBTH") engine maintenance agreements. PBTH contracts transfer certain risk to third-party service providers and fix the amount we pay per flight hour or per cycle to the service provider in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. Under PBTH agreements, the Company recognizes expense at a level rate per engine hour, unless the level of service effort and the related payments during the period are substantially consistent, in which case the Company recognizes expense based on the amounts paid.(p)Advertising&#8212;Advertising costs, which are included in Other operating expenses, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $165 million, $99 million and $87 million for the years ended December;31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(q)Third-Party Business&#8212;The Company has third-party business activity that includes ground handling, maintenance services, flight academy and frequent flyer award non-travel redemptions. Third-party business revenue is recorded in Other operating revenue. Expenses associated with these third-party business activities are recorded in Other operating expenses, except for non-travel mileage redemption. Non-travel mileage redemption expenses are recorded to Other operating revenue.(r)Uncertain Income Tax Positions&#8212;The Company has recorded reserves for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years. Although management believes that its positions taken on income tax matters are reasonable, the Company nevertheless established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions taken by the Company, potentially resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The Company's uncertain tax position reserves are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect its estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitation, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liability, the identification of new tax matters, the release of administrative tax guidance affecting its estimates of tax liabilities, or the rendering of relevant court decisions. The Company records penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense in its consolidated statements of operations. See Note 6 of this report for additional information on UAL's uncertain tax positions.

v3.22.4As of December 31, 2022, approximately 4.6 million shares of UAL's common stock were reserved for future issuance related to the issuance of equity-based awards under the Company's incentive compensation plans. As of December 31, 2022, UAL had two shares of junior preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share) outstanding. In addition, UAL is authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred stock (without par value) under UAL's amended and restated certificate of incorporation.On March 3, 2021, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with several financial institutions (collectively, the "Managers"), relating to the issuance and sale from time to time by UAL (the "2021 ATM Offering"), through the Managers, of up to 37;million shares of UAL common stock (the "2021 ATM Shares"). Sales of the 2021 ATM Shares under the Distribution Agreement may be made in any transactions that are deemed to be "at the market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, UAL may also sell the 2021 ATM Shares to any Manager, as principal for its own account, at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. If UAL sells the 2021 ATM Shares to a Manager as principal, UAL will enter into a separate terms agreement with such Manager. During 2021, approximately 4;million shares were sold in the 2021 ATM Offering at an average price of $57.50 per share, with net proceeds to the Company totaling approximately $250;million. No shares were sold in 2022 under the 2021 ATM Offering.

v3.22.4The table below summarizes UAL's unearned compensation and weighted-average remaining period to recognize costs for all outstanding share-based awards that are probable of being achieved as of December;31, 2022 (in millions, except as noted): RSUs. As of December 31, 2022, UAL had recorded a liability of approximately $3 million related to its cash-settled RSUs. UAL paid approximately $7 million, $29 million and $26 million related to its cash-settled RSUs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The table below summarizes UAL's RSU activity for the years ended December;31 (shares in millions):The fair value of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $274 million, $104 million and $87 million, respectively.Stock Options. UAL did not grant any stock option awards during 2022, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 0.7 million outstanding stock option awards, 0.4 million of which were exercisable, with weighted-average exercise prices of $82.12 and $59.58, respectively, weighted-average remaining contractual lives of 4.3 years and 2.3 years, respectively, and intrinsic values of zero as all of the strike prices exceeded the closing stock price on that date.

v3.22.4Temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions): United and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return with UAL. Under an intercompany tax allocation policy, United and its subsidiaries compute, record and pay UAL for their own tax liability as if they were separate companies filing separate returns. In determining their own tax liabilities, United and each of its subsidiaries take into account all tax credits or benefits generated and utilized as separate companies and they are each compensated for the aforementioned tax benefits only if they would be able to use those benefits on a separate company basis. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset for a temporary interest expense limitation under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") section 163(j) due to law changes resulting from the CARES Act. Interest expense disallowed under IRC section 163(j) can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in future years.The Company's federal and state NOL and tax credit carryforwards relate to current and prior years' NOLs and credits, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future years. These tax benefits are mostly attributable to federal pre-tax NOL carryforwards of $13.2 billion ($2.8 billion tax effected) for UAL. If not utilized these federal pre-tax NOLs will expire as follows (in billions): $0.1 in 2026, $0.5 in 2028, $0.4 in 2029, $0.2 in 2032 and $0.4 in 2033. The remaining $11.6 billion of NOLs has no expiration date. State pre-tax NOLs of $3.9 billion ($0.2 billion tax effected) expire over a 1 to 20-year period. Federal tax credits of $44;million will expire over a 1 to 20-year period and state tax credits of $45;million will expire over a 1 to 15-year period.A tax valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company's management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the Company's ability to realize its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. In order to form a conclusion, management considers positive evidence in the form of taxable income in prior carryback years, reversing temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projections of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, as well as negative evidence such as historical losses. Although the Company incurred losses in 2021 and 2020, management determined that these results were not indicative of future results due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations. The Company concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence, primarily driven by approval and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines as well as increased confidence with the timing of the recovery, as evidenced in our 2022 return to profitability. One of the Company's largest deferred tax assets was its federal pre-tax NOLs which were $13.2;billion ($2.8;billion tax effected) at December 31, 2022. The majority of the NOLs do not expire and the Company expects to realize the benefits of the NOLs and other deferred tax assets through the reversal of certain existing deferred tax liabilities of $6.7 billion and the remaining $0.8 billion through projected future taxable income. Therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and certain state attributes that have short expiration periods. While the Company expects to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize its deferred tax assets (including NOLs), the Company may have to record a valuation allowance, which could be material, against deferred tax assets if negative evidence such as reduced forecasted income outweigh positive evidence. Assumptions about future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage our business. Management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support not recording valuation allowance on these NOLs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded $175;million of valuation allowance against its capital loss deferred tax assets. Capital losses have a limited carryforward period of five years, and they can be utilized only to the extent of capital gains. The Company does not anticipate generating sufficient capital gains to utilize the losses before they expire, therefore, a valuation allowance is necessary as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $24;million on certain state deferred tax assets primarily due to state NOLs that have short expiration periods.The Company's unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $58 million, $55 million and $57 million at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in the ending balance at December 31, 2022 is $58 million that would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized. The changes in unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing authorities, unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period and unrecognized tax benefits relating from a lapse of the statute of limitations were immaterial during 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company does not expect significant increases or decreases in their unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. There are no material amounts included in the balance at December 31, 2022 for tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.The Company's federal income tax returns for tax years after 2002 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and state taxing jurisdictions.

v3.22.4The following information relates to all pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation and a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31 (in millions): Net periodic benefit cost (credit) for the years ended December 31 included the following components (in millions):Service cost is recorded in Salaries and related costs on the statement of consolidated operations. All other components of net periodic benefit costs are recorded in Miscellaneous, net on the statement of consolidated operations. The Company's expected Net periodic benefit cost (credit) for 2023 is as follows (in millions):The assumptions used for the benefit plans were as follows:;The Company used the Society of Actuaries' PRI-2012 Private Retirement Plans Mortality Tables projected generationally using the Society of Actuaries' MP-2021 projection scale.The Company selected the 2022 discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality bonds at December 31, 2022 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match projected benefit payments.We develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit plans based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans' assets.;Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for these plans is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels.;The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio.;Plan fiduciaries regularly review our actual asset allocation and the pension plans' investments are periodically rebalanced to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate.;United's plan assets are allocated within the following guidelines:Fair Value Information. Accounting standards require us to use valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.;These inputs are prioritized as follows:Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on the valuation techniques identified in the tables below. The valuation techniques are as follows:(a) Market approach. Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities; and(b) Income approach. Techniques to convert future amounts to a single current value based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models).The following tables present information about United's pension and other postretirement plan assets at December 31 (in millions):(a) In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value ("NAV") per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. These investments are commingled funds that invest in equity securities and fixed-income instruments including bonds, debt securities, and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. Redemption periods for these investments range from daily to semiannually.Equity and Fixed-Income. Equities include investments in both developed market and emerging market equity securities. Fixed-income includes primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities and non-U.S. corporate fixed-income securities, as well as securitized debt securities.Deposit Administration Fund. This investment is a stable value investment product structured to provide investment income.Alternatives. Alternative investments consist primarily of investments in hedge funds, real estate and private equity interests.Other investments. Other investments consist of primarily cash equivalents, as well as insurance contracts.The following table presents reconciliation of United's benefit plan assets measured at fair value using unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):Funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations.;The Company does not expect any minimum required contributions for 2023 for its tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company expects to make approximately $113 million in contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2023.The estimated future benefit payments, net of expected participant contributions, in United's pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for the next ten years, as of December 31, 2022, are as follows (in millions):Defined Contribution Plans. United offers several defined contribution plans to its employees. Depending upon the employee group, employer contributions consist of matching contributions and/or non-elective employer contributions. United's employer contribution percentages to its primary 401(k) defined contribution plans vary from 1% to 16% of eligible earnings depending on the terms of each plan. United recorded expenses for its primary 401(k) defined contribution plans of $756 million, $651 million and $687 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Multi-Employer Plans. United's participation in the IAM National Pension Plan ("IAM Plan") for the annual period ended December 31, 2022 is outlined in the table below. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans, as United may be subject to additional risks that others do not meet their obligations, which in certain circumstances could revert to United. The IAM Plan reported $507 million in employers' contributions for the year ended December;31, 2021. For 2021, the Company's contributions to the IAM Plan represented more than 5% of total contributions to the IAM Plan. The 2022 information is not available as the applicable Form 5500 is not final for the plan year.Profit Sharing. Substantially all employees participate in profit sharing based on a percentage of pre-tax earnings, excluding special charges, profit sharing expense and share-based compensation. Profit sharing percentages range from 5% to 20% depending on the work group, and in some cases profit sharing percentages vary above and below certain pre-tax margin thresholds.;Eligible U.S. co-workers in each participating work group receive a profit sharing payout using a formula based on the ratio of each qualified co-worker's annual eligible earnings to the eligible earnings of all qualified co-workers in all domestic work groups. Eligible non-U.S. co-workers receive profit sharing based on the calculation under the U.S. profit sharing plan for management and administrative employees. The Company recorded profit sharing and related payroll tax expense of $133;million in 2022. As a result of the pre-tax losses in 2021 and 2020, no profit sharing was recorded. Profit sharing expense is recorded as a component of Salaries and related costs in the Company's statements of consolidated operations.

v3.22.4Lease terms and commitments. United's leases include aircraft leases for aircraft that are directly leased by United and aircraft that are operated by regional carriers on United's behalf under CPAs (but excluding aircraft owned by United) and non-aircraft leases. Aircraft operating leases relate to leases of 99 mainline and 318 regional aircraft while finance leases relate to leases of 26 mainline and 16 regional aircraft. United's aircraft leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 12 years with expiration dates ranging from 2023 through 2034. Under the terms of most aircraft leases, United has the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair market value, and in others, at a percentage of cost.Non-aircraft leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 30 years, with expiration dates ranging from 2023 through 2053.The table below summarizes the Company's scheduled future minimum lease payments under operating and finance leases, recorded on the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):As of December 31, 2022, we have additional leases of approximately $3.0 billion for several regional aircraft under CPAs and airport facility leases that have not yet commenced. These leases will commence starting in 2023 through 2025 with lease terms of up to 12 years.In 2020, United entered into agreements with third parties to finance through sale and leaseback transactions new Boeing model 787 aircraft and Boeing model 737 MAX aircraft subject to purchase agreements between United and Boeing. In connection with the delivery of each aircraft from Boeing, United assigned its right to purchase such aircraft to the buyer, and simultaneous with the buyer's purchase from Boeing, United entered into a long-term lease for such aircraft with the buyer as lessor. Upon delivery of the aircraft in these sale and leaseback transactions, the Company accounted for several of these aircraft, which have a repurchase option at a price other than fair value, as part of Flight equipment on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and the related obligation recorded in Current maturities of other financial liabilities and Other financial liabilities since they did not qualify for sale recognition (failed sale and leaseback). The remaining aircraft that qualified for sale recognition were recorded as Operating lease right-of-use assets and Current/Long-term obligations under operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheet after recognition of related gains on such sale. In 2022, under these sale and leaseback agreements, United exercised repurchase options for six Boeing 787 aircraft. The table below presents the Company's contractual payments at December 31, 2022 under then-outstanding failed sale and leaseback agreements in each of the next five calendar years (in millions):Our lease agreements do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate nor is it available to us from our lessors. Instead, we estimate United's incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value. The table below presents additional information related to our leases as of December 31:The table below presents supplemental cash flow information related to leases during the year ended December 31 (in millions):Regional CPAs. United has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable rate adjustment based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual adjustments. The fees are based on specific rates multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g.,;block hours, departures), as well as fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is also responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In some cases, the Company owns some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA and leases such aircraft to the regional carrier. United's CPAs are for 470 regional aircraft as of December 31, 2022, and the CPAs have terms expiring through 2036. Aircraft operated under CPAs include aircraft leased directly from the regional carriers and those owned by United and operated by the regional carriers. See Part I, Item 2. Properties, of this report for additional information.United recorded approximately $0.9 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.6 billion in expenses related to its CPAs with its regional carriers in which United is a minority shareholder, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. United had notes receivables with carrying values of $62;million and $28;million due from these companies, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no accounts payable due to these companies as of December 31, 2022 and $102 million in accounts payable due to these companies as of December 31, 2021. The CPAs with these related parties were executed in the ordinary course of business.In 2022, United entered into an amended CPA with Mesa to operate, starting in 2023, up to 38 CRJ-900 aircraft with a five-year term, dependent upon the number of Embraer E175 aircraft that Mesa is flying on United's behalf. Additionally in 2022, United amended a majority of its CPA agreements to increase the contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) paid to its regional carriers. The Company plans to wind down its CPA with Air Wisconsin in 2023.Our future commitments under our CPAs are dependent on numerous variables, and are, therefore, difficult to predict.;The most important of these variables is the number of scheduled block hours.;Although we are not required to purchase a minimum number of block hours under certain of our CPAs, we have set forth below estimates of our future payments under the CPAs based on our assumptions.;The actual amounts we pay to our regional operators under CPAs could differ materially from these estimates. United's estimates of its future payments under all of the CPAs do not include the portion of the underlying obligation for any aircraft leased to a regional carrier or deemed to be leased from other regional carriers and facility rent that are disclosed as part of operating leases above.;For purposes of calculating these estimates, we have assumed (1) the number of block hours flown is based on our anticipated level of flight activity or at any contractual minimum utilization levels if applicable, whichever is higher, (2) that we will reduce the fleet as rapidly as contractually allowed under each CPA, (3) that aircraft utilization, stage length and load factors will remain constant, (4) that each carrier's operational performance will remain at recent historic levels and (5) an annual projected inflation rate. These amounts exclude variable pass-through costs such as fuel and landing fees, among others. Based on these assumptions as of December 31, 2022, our future payments through the end of the terms of our CPAs are presented in the table below (in billions):



LEASES AND CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS
LEASES AND CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTSUnited leases aircraft, airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities, other commercial real estate, office and computer equipment and vehicles, among other items. Certain of these leases include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on several factors, including, but not limited to, relative leased square footage, available seat miles, enplaned passengers, passenger facility charges, terminal equipment usage fees, departures, and airports' annual operating budgets. Due to the variable nature of the rates, these leases are not recorded on our balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and lease liability.For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related right-of-use asset and lease liability at the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. To the extent a lease agreement includes an extension option that is reasonably certain to be exercised, we have recognized those amounts as part of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less with purchase options or extension options that are not reasonably certain to be exercised are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We combine lease and non-lease components, such as common area maintenance costs, in calculating the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all asset groups except for our CPAs, which contain embedded leases for regional aircraft. In addition to the lease component cost for regional aircraft, our CPAs also include non-lease components primarily related to the regional carriers' operating costs incurred in providing regional aircraft services. We allocate consideration for the lease components and non-lease components of each CPA based on their relative standalone values.Lease Cost. The Company's lease cost for the years ended December 31 included the following components (in millions):Lease terms and commitments. United's leases include aircraft leases for aircraft that are directly leased by United and aircraft that are operated by regional carriers on United's behalf under CPAs (but excluding aircraft owned by United) and non-aircraft leases. Aircraft operating leases relate to leases of 99 mainline and 318 regional aircraft while finance leases relate to leases of 26 mainline and 16 regional aircraft. United's aircraft leases have remaining lease terms of 1 month to 12 years with expiration dates ranging from 2023 through 2034.

In 2022, under these sale and leaseback agreements, United exercised repurchase options for six Boeing 787 aircraft. The table below presents the Company's contractual payments at December 31, 2022 under then-outstanding failed sale and leaseback agreements in each of the next five calendar years (in millions):Our lease agreements do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate nor is it available to us from our lessors.

v3.22.4The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2033. The amount and timing of the Company's future capital commitments could change to the extent that: (i) the Company and the aircraft manufacturers, with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft, agree to modify the contracts governing those orders; (ii) rights are exercised pursuant to the relevant agreements to modify the timing of deliveries; or (iii) the aircraft manufacturers are unable to deliver in accordance with the terms of those orders. Airbus notified United that eight Airbus A321neo aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, are now expected to deliver in 2024, and Boeing notified United that 37 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, are now expected to deliver in 2024. Also, United estimates that an additional six Boeing 737 MAX aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2023, as shown in the table above, will deliver in 2024.In December 2022, the Company entered into a confidential settlement with Boeing with respect to compensation for aircraft manufacturer delivery delays in 2020 through 2022 related to Boeing 787 aircraft. The compensation is in the form of credit memos to be issued at future dates upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company is accounting for this settlement as a reduction to the cost basis of certain existing and future firm order Boeing 787 aircraft, which is expected to reduce future depreciation expense associated with these aircraft.The table below summarizes United's commitments as of December 31, 2022, which include aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and all non-aircraft capital commitments (in billions):Legal and Environmental. The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2022, management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and the ultimate disposition of any pending matter will not materially affect the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition.During 2022, the Company recorded charges of $94;million as a result of a number of recent decisions that appear to impact the Company's ability to successfully assert, in certain cases, that federal law preempts state and local laws that conflict with union contracts and/or federal requirements. Guarantees and Indemnifications. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnities under which the Company typically indemnifies the lessors and any tax/financing parties against liabilities that arise out of or relate to the use, operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft. Currently, the Company believes that any future payments required under these guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most liabilities and related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles). Additionally, certain real estate leases include indemnities for any environmental liability that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premises.As of December 31, 2022, United is the guarantor of approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with these obligations are accounted for as operating leases recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheet with the associated expense recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The obligations associated with these tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds are included in our lease commitments disclosed in Note 10 of this report. All of these bonds are due between 2023 and 2041.As of December 31, 2022, United is the guarantor of $92 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of United's regional carriers. The aircraft mortgage debt is subject to similar increased cost provisions as described below for the Company's debt, and the Company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees.As of December 31, 2022, United had $377 million of surety bonds securing various insurance related obligations with expiration dates through 2027.Increased Cost Provisions. In United's financing transactions that include loans in which United is the borrower, United typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans with respect to which the interest rate is based on LIBOR or SOFR, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject, in most cases, to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for, or the amount of, such increased costs. At December;31, 2022, the Company had $12.9 billion of floating rate debt with remaining terms of up to 12 years that are subject to these increased cost provisions.;In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with remaining terms of up to 12 years and an aggregate balance of $9.8 billion, the Company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.Fuel Consortia. United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds, either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds, issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December;31, 2022, approximately $2.5 billion principal amount of such bonds was secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December;31, 2022, the Company's contingent exposure was approximately $400 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Company's contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2023 to 2056. The Company concluded it was not necessary to record a liability for these indirect guarantees.Regional Capacity Purchase. As of December 31, 2022, United had 255 call options to purchase regional jet aircraft being operated by certain of its regional carriers with contract dates extending until 2029. These call options are exercisable upon wrongful termination or breach of contract, among other conditions.Credit Card Processing Agreements. The Company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of the Company's credit card processing agreements, the financial institutions in certain circumstances have the right to require that the Company maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that has been processed by that financial institution, but for which the Company has not yet provided the air transportation. Such financial institutions may require additional cash or other collateral reserves to be established or additional withholding of payments related to receivables collected if the Company does not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (collectively, "Unrestricted Liquidity"). The Company's current level of Unrestricted Liquidity is substantially in excess of these minimum levels.Labor Negotiations. As of December 31, 2022, United, including its subsidiaries, had approximately 92,800 employees. Approximately 84% of United's employees were represented by various U.S. labor organizations. In November 2022, United dispatchers represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association voted to ratify a two-year contract extension. Also, in January 2023, United and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ratified an extension to its labor contract covering the Company's more than 8,000 technicians and related employees. The agreement becomes amendable in December 2024 and includes a one-year early opener that allows for bargaining on a successor agreement to begin in December 2023.
